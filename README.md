- Reconnaissance
  - The observation stage:
    - attackers typically assess the situation from the outside-in, in order to identify both targets and tactics for the attack.

- Intrusion
  - Based on what the attackers discovered in the reconnaissance phase, theyâ€™re able to get into your systems:
    - often leveraging malware or security vulnerabilities.

- Exploitation
The act of exploiting vulnerabilities, and delivering malicious code onto the system, in order to get a better foothold.

- Privilege Escalation
  - Attackers often need more privileges on a system to get access to more data and permissions:
    - for this, they need to escalate their privileges often to an Admin.

- Lateral Movement
  - Once theyâ€™re in the system, attackers can move laterally to other systems and accounts in order to gain more leverage:
    - whether thatâ€™s higher permissions, more data, or greater access to systems.

- Obfuscation / Anti-forensics
  - In order to successfully pull off a cyberattack, attackers need to cover their tracks, and in this stage they often lay false trails, compromise data, and clear logs to confuse and/or slow down any forensics team.

- Denial of Service
  - Disruption of normal access for users and systems, in order to stop the attack from being monitored, tracked, or blocked

- Exfiltration
  - The extraction stage:
    - getting data out of the compromised system.
