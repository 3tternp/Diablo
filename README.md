  1) Steps Example
  </summary>

# Reconnaissance
- The observation stage:
  - attackers typically assess the situation from the outside-in, in order to identify both targets and tactics for the attack.

# Intrusion
- Based on what the attackers discovered in the reconnaissance phase, theyâ€™re able to get into your systems:
  - often leveraging malware or security vulnerabilities.

# Exploitation
- The act of exploiting vulnerabilities, and delivering malicious code onto the system, in order to get a better foothold.

# Privilege Escalation
- Attackers often need more privileges on a system to get access to more data and permissions:
  - for this, they need to escalate their privileges often to an Admin.

# Lateral Movement
- Once theyâ€™re in the system, attackers can move laterally to other systems and accounts in order to gain more leverage:
  - whether thatâ€™s higher permissions, more data, or greater access to systems.

# Obfuscation / Anti-forensics
- In order to successfully pull off a cyberattack, attackers need to cover their tracks, and in this stage they often lay false trails, compromise data, and clear logs to confuse and/or slow down any forensics team.

# Denial of Service
- Disruption of normal access for users and systems, in order to stop the attack from being monitored, tracked, or blocked

# Exfiltration
- The extraction stage:
  - getting data out of the compromised system.
